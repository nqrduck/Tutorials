# 1. NQRduck Simulator Tutorial ðŸ¦†
## Introduction
This Tutorial gives a short overview of how to use the NQRduck Simulator. The NQRduck Simulator is a module of the NQRduck program that allows you to simulate NQR signals and spectra.

## Requirements
* All requirements from the [NQRduck Setup Tutorial](0_NQRduck_Setup.md)

## Steps (Linux)
1. Switch to the Spectrometer module in the NQRduck program.

2. You can now see two different sections in the Spectrometer module:
    - The left side are the spectrometer settings. These are values that don't  change during a Pulse Sequence.
    - The right side is the Pulse Programmer. Here you can create sequences of pulses that are executed during the simulation.

3. Create a simple Free Induction Decay (FID) sequence in the pulse programmer on the right side:
    - A sequence is made up of different events that are executed subsequently. Different events are rows in the pulse programmer table. 
    - For every event you can specify a certain length and a name. 
    - Every event now has Pulse Parameters associated with it. For the Simulator, these are the TX and the RX Pulse Parameters.

    The picture shows an exemplary FID sequence.
    - a.) The different events.
        - Pulse is our TX Pulse that excites the sample.
        - Blank is a waiting time between the TX Pulse and the RX Readout in order to await coil ringing.
        - RX is the ADC Readout that measures the signal.
        - TR is the repetition time between the different averages. 
    - b.) The Pulse Parameters for the selected event.
    - c.) The Pulse Parameters for the TX Pulse.
    - d.) The Pulse Parameters for the ADC Readout.
    - e.) The duration of the different events

4. You can now adjust the settings  of the Simulator on the right side. Different settings are for example the number of simulation points or the noise level.

5. To start the simulation, switch back to the `Measurement` tab. Enter a `Target Frequency` of 83.56MHy and 100 `Averages`. No press the `Start Measurement` button.

6. You should see an exponential decay in the plot. This is the FID signal that you just simulated.
 - The signal might look weird if you didn't set the correct Pulse Parameters. Try to adjust either the length of your TX event or the pulse power to achieve a $\frac{\pi}{2}$ flip angle.

 7. Try setting the experiment temperature to 77K and see how the signal changes.

 9. Save your pulse sequence by clicking on the `Save pulse sequence` button in the Pulse Programmer.

 8. Next try to implement a Spin Echo (SE) sequence. Try to center your RX event around the echo of the signal. Play around with relaxation times and see how the signal changes.

10. If you found a pulse sequence that you like, you can save it by clicking on the `Save pulse sequence` button in the Pulse Programmer.

11. We will now run these sequences on the real hardware. See [Tutorial 2](2_LimeNQR.md) for more information.

## Notes:
With some of the last updates I broke the signal processing options. I will fix this in the next update. For now, you can only simulate the signal and not process it. Or you can try the apodization but the program might crash.
